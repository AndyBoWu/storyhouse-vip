- **Testing**: Foundry test commands and coverage requirements
- **Architecture**: [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for system design

### For Deployers  
- **Deployment**: [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete deployment guide
- **Configuration**: Contract setup and role management
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and emergency procedures

### For Auditors
- **Security**: [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for security principles
- **Changes**: [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for recent modifications
- **Contracts**: [CONTRACTS.md](./CONTRACTS.md) for detailed implementation

## üîç Key Features

### Current Architecture (V2)
- **4 Core Contracts**: Streamlined from 5-contract architecture
- **Permissionless**: Anyone can register books without admin approval
- **Anti-Farming**: Eliminated automatic rewards prone to bot exploitation
- **Gas Optimized**: Reduced cross-contract calls and dependencies

### Security Highlights
- ‚úÖ **OpenZeppelin v5** battle-tested security patterns
- ‚úÖ **ReentrancyGuard** protection on all external calls  
- ‚úÖ **AccessControl** role-based permissions
- ‚úÖ **Pausable** emergency controls
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Testing** with edge case coverage

### Business Model
- **Revenue Sharing**: 70% author, 20% curator, 10% platform
- **Chapter Pricing**: Free chapters 1-3, 0.5 TIP for chapters 4+
- **Permissionless Registration**: Authors control their own books
- **IP Integration**: Story Protocol compatibility

## üîß Development Workflow

### 1. Read Documentation
- Start with [main README](../README.md) for overview
- Review [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for system design
- Check [CONTRACTS.md](./CONTRACTS.md) for specific contract details

### 2. Local Development
```bash

```

### 3. Deployment
- Follow [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for deployment procedures
- Test on local/testnet before mainnet
- Verify contracts and configure permissions

### 4. Integration
- Update frontend with new contract addresses
- Test end-to-end functionality
- Monitor for any issues
