# Smart Contract Changelog

## January 2025 - V2 Architecture & Security Improvements

### üöÄ Major Updates

#### HybridRevenueControllerV2 - Permissionless Book Registration
- **Added**: `HybridRevenueControllerV2.sol` - Permissionless version of revenue controller
- **Added**: `HybridRevenueControllerV2Standalone.sol` - Clean implementation without dependencies
- **Feature**: Anyone can now register books without admin approval
- **Feature**: `msg.sender` automatically becomes curator when registering books
- **Compatibility**: Maintains same revenue distribution model (70/20/10)
- **Compatibility**: Backward compatible interfaces with V1

#### Security & Anti-Farming Improvements
- **Removed**: `RewardsManager.sol` - Eliminated complex reward system prone to farming
- **Removed**: `UnifiedRewardsController.sol` - Removed automatic creation rewards
- **Security**: Eliminated 50 TIP/story and 20 TIP/chapter automatic rewards
- **Security**: Rewards now only generated from genuine chapter purchases
- **Security**: No more read-to-earn mechanics that could be gamed

#### ChapterAccessController Removal
- **Removed**: `ChapterAccessController.sol` - Functionality merged into HybridRevenueControllerV2
- **Benefit**: Simplified architecture with only 2 contracts
- **Benefit**: Single contract handles both access control and revenue distribution
- **Maintained**: Same chapter pricing (free 1-3, 0.5 TIP for 4+)
- **Maintained**: Author revenue distribution in HybridRevenueControllerV2

### üìä Architecture Changes

#### Before (5 Contracts)
1. TIPToken.sol
2. RewardsManager.sol ‚ùå
3. UnifiedRewardsController.sol ‚ùå
4. ChapterAccessController.sol ‚ùå
5. HybridRevenueController.sol ‚ùå

#### After (2 Contracts)
1. TIPToken.sol ‚úÖ
2. HybridRevenueControllerV2.sol ‚úÖ (includes chapter access control)

### üîí Security Enhancements

#### Removed Attack Vectors
- **Automatic Creation Rewards**: Prevented AI/bot farming of story creation
- **Read-to-Earn Gaming**: Eliminated fake reading completion rewards
- **Complex Reward Logic**: Simplified architecture reduces potential exploits

#### Enhanced Access Control
- **Permissionless Registration**: No admin bottlenecks for book creation
- **Self-Custody**: Authors control their own books and revenue
- **Role Simplification**: Fewer special roles, reduced privilege escalation risks

### üéØ Business Logic Changes

#### Revenue Model (Unchanged)
- Author: 70%
- Curator: 20% 
- Platform: 10%

#### Chapter Pricing (Unchanged)
- Chapters 1-3: Free
- Chapters 4+: 0.5 TIP

#### New Features
- **Permissionless Book Registration**: Authors can create books without admin approval
- **Automatic Curator Assignment**: Book registrant becomes curator automatically
- **Simplified Dependencies**: Standalone versions available

### üß™ Testing Updates

#### New Test Coverage
- V2 contract functionality tests
- Permissionless registration scenarios
- Revenue distribution accuracy
- Security vulnerability prevention

#### Legacy Test Maintenance
- V1 contracts maintain existing test coverage
- Backward compatibility verification

### üîÑ Migration Strategy

#### Deployment Approach
1. Deploy V2 contracts alongside existing V1
2. Update frontend to use V2 for new books
3. Maintain V1 support for existing books
4. Optional migration tools for legacy books

#### Backward Compatibility
- V1 contracts remain fully functional
- V2 maintains same interfaces where applicable
- No breaking changes for existing users
- Gradual migration path available
