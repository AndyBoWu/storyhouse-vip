# Liquid Glass Design System Integration

## Overview
This directory contains all documentation related to the integration of Apple's Liquid Glass design system into StoryHouse.vip. The goal is to create a visually stunning, modern Web3 storytelling platform with fluid, glass-morphic interfaces that enhance user experience without compromising performance.

## Design System Reference

We're using the [liquid-glass-react](https://github.com/rdev/liquid-glass-react) library, which provides:
- WebGL-based glass effects
- Real-time displacement and refraction
- Elastic, fluid animations
- High-performance GPU rendering

## Key Features

1. **Glass Morphism Effects**
   - Dynamic blur and transparency
   - Chromatic aberration
   - Light refraction simulation

2. **Fluid Interactions**
   - Elastic mouse tracking
   - Spring physics animations
   - Smooth state transitions

3. **Performance Optimized**
   - GPU acceleration
   - Adaptive quality settings
   - Mobile-specific optimizations

## Getting Started

1. Review the [Ticket Tracking](./TICKETS.md) document to understand project scope
2. Read the [Technical Specification](./TECHNICAL_SPEC.md) for architecture details
3. Follow the [Implementation Guide](./IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) to start building
4. Use [Design Guidelines](./DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md) to maintain consistency
