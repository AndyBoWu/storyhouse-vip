# StoryHouse.vip Product Proposal

**Owner**: @Andy Wu
**Date**: Updated December 2024
**Status**: Active Development - Monorepo with Smart Contracts

## Executive Summary

StoryHouse.vip is a revolutionary AI-assisted storytelling platform built on Story Protocol's Layer 1 blockchain with read-to-earn tokenomics. The platform enables creators to collaboratively work with AI to produce serialized content while establishing a novel reader-writer economy powered by $TIP tokens. Users provide creative concepts that AI transforms into engaging chapters, creating an interactive publishing ecosystem where readers earn rewards for reading, creators monetize content, and the community participates in recursive content remixing.
