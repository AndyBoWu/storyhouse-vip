# Collaborative Storytelling System

## Overview & Vision

StoryHouse.vip implements a revolutionary collaborative storytelling platform using Story Protocol's IP licensing system. Writers can create branching narratives where any reader can purchase remix licenses to continue or diverge from existing stories, creating an infinite multiverse of interconnected tales.

### Core Innovation
- **Chapter-level IP Assets**: Each chapter is a separate IP asset with its own licensing terms
- **Branching Narratives**: Readers can branch from any chapter to create alternate storylines
- **Automatic Royalties**: Parent chapters earn royalties from derivative works through blockchain-native distribution
- **Community-Driven Stories**: Stories evolve through community participation rather than single authorship

## Reading vs Remix Licenses

### Reading Licenses
**Purpose**: Personal consumption access to paid chapters
- **Transferable**: `false` (locked to wallet)
- **Commercial Use**: `false` (personal reading only)
- **Derivatives Allowed**: `false` (cannot create derivative works)
- **Price**: 0.5 TIP tokens for chapters 4+
- **Chapters 1-3**: FREE (no license required)

### Remix Licenses  
**Purpose**: Permission to create derivative chapters based on existing content
- **Transferable**: `true` (can be sold/traded)
- **Commercial Use**: `true` (can monetize derivative works)
- **Derivatives Allowed**: `true` (full creative rights)
- **Price**: Set by original author (suggested: 10+ TIP tokens)
- **Author Control**: Each author decides if their chapters allow remixes

## Chapter Branching Rules

### Eligibility Requirements
To purchase a remix license for Chapter N, the user must:
1. **Target chapter allows remixes** (author setting)
2. **Write the next sequential chapter** (N+1) in the story

### Branching Logic
To purchase a remix license for a chapter, the user must:
- **Target chapter allows remixes** (author setting)
- **Write the next sequential chapter** (N+1) in the story
- **No reading prerequisites required** - writers can jump in at any chapter

### Story Paths Example
**Andy's Original Story:**
Chapter 1 (Andy) → Chapter 2 (Andy) → Chapter 3 (Andy) → Chapter 4 (Andy)

**Possible Branches:**
- **Branch from Chapter 1:** Ch1 (Andy) → Ch2 (Bob) → Ch3 (Bob) → Ch4 (Cecilia)
- **Branch from Chapter 2:** Ch1 (Andy) → Ch2 (Andy) → Ch3 (Daisy) → Ch4 (Andy)
- **Branch from Chapter 3:** Ch1 (Andy) → Ch2 (Andy) → Ch3 (Andy) → Ch4 (Bob)

## Story Genealogy System

### IP Asset Hierarchy
Each chapter is registered as a Story Protocol IP Asset with genealogy tracking:

Each chapter contains:
- **Basic Info:** Title, content, author, chapter number
- **Story Protocol Integration:** IP Asset ID, parent relationships, license terms
- **Genealogy Tracking:** Story root, parent chapter, branches, generation level
- **Access Control:** Reading price (0.5 TIP for ch4+), remix price (author-set), remix permissions

### Family Tree Visualization

## Royalty Distribution

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Reader Purchases Chapter Access: 0.5 TIP] --> B{Generation Level}
    B -->|Single Gen| C[Author: 85%<br/>Parent: 10%<br/>Platform: 5%]
    B -->|Multi Gen| D[Author: 70%<br/>Parent: 15%<br/>Grandparent: 10%<br/>Great-GP: 3%<br/>Platform: 2%]
    C --> E[Automatic Distribution]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Royalties Sent to Wallets]
```

### Revenue Sharing Model
When readers purchase access to derivative chapters, revenue flows up the genealogy chain:

#### Single Generation (Direct Derivative)
**Bob's Chapter 2** (derived from Andy's Chapter 1)
When a reader pays 0.5 TIP for access:
- **Bob (Author):** 85% = 0.425 TIP
- **Andy (Parent):** 10% = 0.05 TIP  
- **Platform:** 5% = 0.025 TIP

#### Multi-Generation (Deep Derivative)
**Daisy's Chapter 4** (derived from Cecilia's Chapter 3 → Andy's Chapter 2 → Andy's Chapter 1)
When a reader pays 0.5 TIP for access:
- **Daisy (Author):** 70% = 0.35 TIP
- **Cecilia (Parent Ch3):** 15% = 0.075 TIP
- **Andy (Grandparent Ch2):** 10% = 0.05 TIP
- **Andy (Great-grandparent Ch1):** 3% = 0.015 TIP
- **Platform:** 2% = 0.01 TIP

#### Remix License Sales
**When someone buys remix license for Bob's Chapter 2 (25 TIP):**
- **Bob (Chapter Author):** 80% = 20 TIP
- **Andy (Parent):** 15% = 3.75 TIP
- **Platform:** 5% = 1.25 TIP

### Royalty Decay Model
- **Direct derivative**: Parent gets 10-15%
- **Second generation**: Grandparent gets 5-10%  
- **Third generation**: Great-grandparent gets 3-5%
- **Fourth+ generations**: Minimal percentage (1-2%)
- **Maximum ancestors**: Limit to 5 generations to prevent micro-payments
