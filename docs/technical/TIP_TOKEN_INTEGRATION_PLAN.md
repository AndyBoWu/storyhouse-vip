# TIP Token Integration with Story Protocol

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating StoryHouse's native TIP token with Story Protocol's IP management system. The solution uses LAP (Liquid Absolute Percentage) royalty policy for all license tiers to avoid Story Protocol's currency token whitelist requirements while maintaining full control over TIP token economics.

## Problem Statement

Story Protocol's LRP (Liquid Royalty Policy) requires whitelisted currency tokens for royalty-bearing licenses. Since TIP token is not on their whitelist, attempting to publish premium/exclusive chapters results in "Royalty policy requires currency token" errors.

## Solution Architecture

### Core Approach (Simplified Solution)
1. **Zero address royalty policy for ALL tiers** - Completely bypasses Story Protocol's royalty system
2. **Zero address currency for ALL tiers** - No token dependencies
3. **HybridRevenueController manages 100% of revenue** - Complete control over TIP token distribution
4. **Story Protocol handles IP registration only** - Pure IP management without payment complexity

### Key Components

#### 1. Story Protocol Integration
- **Royalty Policy**: Zero address (0x0000...0000) for all tiers
- **Currency**: Zero address (0x0000...0000) for all tiers
- **License Management**: Story Protocol tracks IP ownership and licensing terms only
- **License NFTs**: Minted by Story Protocol as proof of licensing rights
- **Revenue Role**: None - all payments handled externally

#### 2. HybridRevenueController (0xd1F7e8c6FD77dADbE946aE3e4141189b39Ef7b08)
- **Payment Processing**: Handles all TIP token transactions
- **Revenue Distribution**: Automatic 70/20/10 split (author/curator/platform)
- **Chapter Attribution**: Tracks original authors and source books
- **Unlock Management**: Records which users have unlocked which chapters

#### 3. TIP Token (0xe5Cd6E2392eB0854F207Ad474ee9FB98d80C934E)
- **Native Currency**: All payments in TIP tokens
- **No WIP Dependency**: No need for Story Protocol's wrapped tokens
- **Full Control**: Complete authority over token economics

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Integration (Immediate - High Priority)

#### 1.1 Verify LAP Policy Implementation
- **Objective**: Ensure LAP policy works for all license tiers
- **Tasks**:
  - Test publishing with free, reading, premium, and exclusive tiers
  - Verify Story Protocol accepts zero address currency
  - Confirm no "currency token required" errors
- **Success Criteria**: All tiers publish successfully without errors

#### 1.2 Test Premium/Exclusive Publishing
- **Objective**: Validate Andy can publish Chapter 4
- **Tasks**:
  - Publish test chapter with premium tier
  - Verify IP registration completes
  - Check license terms attachment
- **Success Criteria**: Chapter 4 publishes with correct license terms

### Phase 2: Revenue System Integration (High Priority)

#### 2.1 Publishing Flow Integration
```typescript
// When author publishes a chapter:
1. Register IP with Story Protocol (existing flow)
2. Register chapter in HybridRevenueController:
   - Chapter ID
   - Author address
   - Unlock price
   - Book ID
   - Story Protocol IP ID
```

#### 2.2 Chapter Unlock Flow
```typescript
// When reader unlocks a chapter:
1. Check reader's TIP balance
2. Call HybridRevenueController.unlockChapter()
3. Contract automatically splits payment:
   - 70% to author
   - 20% to curator (if derivative book)
   - 10% to platform
4. Mint Story Protocol license NFT (free)
5. Grant reader access to chapter content
```

#### 2.3 Unified Payment Architecture
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Reader] -->|Pays TIP| B[HybridRevenueController]
    B -->|70%| C[Author]
    B -->|20%| D[Curator]
    B -->|10%| E[Platform]
    B -->|Triggers| F[Story Protocol]
    F -->|Mints| G[License NFT]
    G -->|Grants Access| A
```

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Medium Priority)

#### 3.1 Revenue Dashboard
- **Author View**:
  - Total earnings across all chapters
  - Chapter-by-chapter breakdown
  - Real-time payment notifications
  - Withdrawal interface
  
- **Platform Admin View**:
  - Total platform fees collected
  - Revenue analytics
  - Author performance metrics
  - Fee withdrawal controls

#### 3.2 Error Handling & UX
- **Balance Checks**: Verify sufficient TIP before transactions
- **Clear Messaging**: User-friendly error descriptions
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for transient failures
- **Transaction Status**: Real-time updates during processing

### Phase 4: Documentation & Future Enhancements (Low Priority)

#### 4.1 Documentation Updates
- User guides for the new payment flow
- Developer API documentation
- Troubleshooting guide
- FAQ section

#### 4.2 Future Enhancements
- **Atomic Wrapper Contract**: Single transaction for payment + licensing
- **Batch Operations**: Unlock multiple chapters efficiently
- **Advanced Royalties**: Complex revenue sharing models
- **Cross-Chain Support**: Expand to other blockchains

## Technical Implementation Details

### Smart Contract Interactions

#### Publishing a Chapter
```solidity
// 1. Story Protocol Registration (client-side)
storyClient.ipAsset.mintAndRegisterIpAssetWithPilTerms({
    spgNftContract: STORYHOUSE_NFT_ADDRESS,
    licenseTermsData: [{
        terms: {
            royaltyPolicy: LAP_POLICY_ADDRESS,
            currency: ZERO_ADDRESS,
            commercialRevShare: 0, // Handled by HybridRevenueController
            // ... other PIL terms
        }
    }],
    // ... metadata
})

// 2. Revenue Controller Registration (backend API)
hybridRevenueController.setChapterAttribution(
    bookId,
    chapterNumber,
    ChapterAttribution({
        originalAuthor: authorAddress,
        sourceBookId: bookId,
        unlockPrice: chapterPrice,
        isOriginalContent: true
    })
)
```

#### Unlocking a Chapter
```solidity
// 1. Frontend checks balance
const balance = await tipToken.balanceOf(readerAddress)
if (balance < unlockPrice) throw new Error("Insufficient TIP balance")

// 2. Reader approves TIP spending
await tipToken.approve(HYBRID_REVENUE_CONTROLLER, unlockPrice)

// 3. Unlock chapter (handles payment distribution)
await hybridRevenueController.unlockChapter(bookId, chapterNumber)

// 4. Mint license NFT from Story Protocol (free with LAP)
await storyClient.license.mintLicenseTokens({
    licensorIpId: chapterIpId,
    licenseTermsId: licenseTermsId,
    amount: 1,
    receiver: readerAddress
})
```

### Configuration Updates

#### Backend Service (advancedStoryProtocolService.ts)
```typescript
// All tiers use zero address for both royalty policy and currency
premium: {
    royaltyPolicy: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000', // Zero address
    currency: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000', // Zero address
    // ... other config
}
```

#### Frontend Client (storyProtocolClient.ts)
```typescript
// Matching configuration for client-side registration
premium: {
    royaltyPolicy: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000', // Zero address
    currency: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000', // Zero address
    // ... other config
}
```

## Technical Rationale: Why Zero Address?

### LAP vs LRP vs Zero Address Comparison

| Feature | LAP | LRP | Zero Address |
|---------|-----|-----|--------------|
| Currency Requirement | Still needs configuration | Requires whitelisted token | None |
| Complexity | Medium | High | Low |
| TIP Token Support | Indirect | No | Direct |
| Control | Partial | Limited | Full |
| Gas Costs | Higher | Highest | Lowest |
| Future Flexibility | Limited | Very Limited | Maximum |

### Decision: Zero Address for All Tiers
After thorough analysis, using zero address for royalty policy is the optimal solution because:
1. **Simplicity**: No Story Protocol royalty configuration needed
2. **Independence**: No reliance on Story Protocol's token whitelist
3. **Efficiency**: Lowest gas costs, single payment flow
4. **Control**: 100% revenue control through HybridRevenueController
5. **User Experience**: Users only need TIP tokens

## Benefits of This Approach

### For StoryHouse
- âœ… **Full TIP Token Control**: No dependency on external tokens
- âœ… **Custom Economics**: Implement any revenue model
- âœ… **Story Protocol Benefits**: IP tracking, licensing, provenance
- âœ… **Gas Efficiency**: Single unified registration transaction

### For Authors
- âœ… **Higher Earnings**: 70% revenue share
- âœ… **Transparent Payments**: On-chain verification
- âœ… **IP Protection**: Story Protocol registration
