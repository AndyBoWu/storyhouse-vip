# SDK Upgrade and PIL Implementation Plan

## Overview
✅ **COMPLETED** - This plan covered the high-priority tasks for upgrading Story Protocol SDK from v1.3.1 to v1.3.2 and implementing the PIL (Programmable IP License) licensing system. This represents Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3) of the comprehensive Story Protocol enhancement roadmap.

**Completion Date**: June 11, 2025  
**Final Status**: All objectives achieved with enhanced error handling and real blockchain integration  
**Documentation Updated**: December 11, 2025

## Current Problem Analysis ✅ RESOLVED
- ✅ **SDK Version Gap**: Successfully upgraded to v1.3.2 with all breaking changes resolved
- ✅ **Limited IP Features**: Now ~60% of SDK capabilities implemented with PIL system
- ✅ **No Licensing System**: PIL licensing fully integrated with real blockchain operations
- ✅ **Disabled Features**: All blockchain features re-enabled with enhanced error handling
