**Scope**: Added derivative analytics methods with TypeScript support

**New Methods**:
```typescript
getDerivativeAnalytics(storyId: string): Promise<DerivativeAnalytics>
getContentSimilarity(originalId: string, derivativeId: string): Promise<ContentSimilarityAnalysis>
getInfluenceMetrics(authorAddress: string): Promise<InfluenceMetrics>
getQualityAssessment(storyId: string): Promise<QualityAssessment>
```

**Type Definitions**:
- Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Added to shared types for cross-app usage
