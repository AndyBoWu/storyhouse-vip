# Phase 2: Royalty Distribution System Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan details the implementation of Phase 2 of the Story Protocol SDK enhancement roadmap, focusing on automated royalty distribution and TIP token integration. Building on the successful Phase 1 PIL licensing foundation, Phase 2 enables creators to claim and manage royalties from their licensed content.

**Current Status**: 🎉 **~90% COMPLETE** - All Backend Infrastructure Complete

## Phase 2 Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Basic Royalty Claiming Infrastructure** - Individual chapter royalty claiming
2. **TIP Token Integration** - Connect Story Protocol royalties with TIP token economics
3. **Manual Claiming System** - User-controlled royalty claiming with real-time notifications
4. **Foundation for Phase 3** - Extensible architecture for advanced features

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Creators can manually claim royalties from individual chapters
- ✅ Real-time notifications when new royalties become available
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing TIP token economics
- ✅ <3s operation time for royalty claiming
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with actionable guidance
- ✅ Production-ready deployment on testnet and mainnet

## Architecture Strategy

### Hybrid Service Approach ✅ RECOMMENDED
Based on comprehensive architecture analysis, we'll use a hybrid approach:

1. **Extend `AdvancedStoryProtocolService`** - For blockchain operations
   - Chapter-level royalty claiming via Story Protocol SDK
   - Integration with existing PIL license tiers
   - Consistent error handling and blockchain interaction patterns

2. **Create New `RoyaltyService`** - For business logic and TIP integration
   - TIP token balance management and distribution
   - Royalty calculation and revenue sharing
   - Real-time notification system
   - Royalty history and analytics

3. **Integration Layer** - Coordinate between services
   - Convert Story Protocol royalties to TIP token rewards
   - Handle notification triggers and user experience
   - Maintain separation of concerns while ensuring seamless operation
