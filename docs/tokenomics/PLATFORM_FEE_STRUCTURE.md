---

## ðŸ“Š **Chapter Unlock Fees**

### **Free Chapters (1-3)**
- **Reader Cost**: 0 TIP
- **Platform Fee**: 0%

---

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **Smart Contract**: `ChapterAccessController.sol`
```solidity
uint256 public authorRevenueShare = 80; // 80% to author
// Platform gets remaining 20%

function _distributeRevenue(
    bytes32 bookId,
    uint256 chapterNumber,
    uint256 amount,
    address author
) internal {
    uint256 authorShare = (amount * authorRevenueShare) / 100; // 0.4 TIP
    uint256 platformShare = amount - authorShare;             // 0.1 TIP
    
    // Transfer to author immediately
    tipToken.transfer(author, authorShare);
    
    // Platform share stays in contract
    platformTotalEarnings += platformShare;
}
```

### **Blockchain Recording**
Every unlock is permanently recorded:
- **Event**: `ChapterUnlocked(reader, bookId, chapterNumber, unlockPrice, timestamp)`
- **Storage**: `hasUnlockedChapter[user][book][chapter] = true`
- **Progress**: `userUnlockedChapters[book][user] = latestChapter`

## ðŸ’¡ **Revenue Flow Example**

**Scenario**: Bob unlocks Chapter 4 of Andy's book "The Detective's Portal"

1. **Payment**: Bob pays 0.5 TIP from his wallet
2. **Smart Contract Split**:
   - Andy receives: 0.4 TIP (80%)
   - Platform keeps: 0.1 TIP (20%)
3. **Recording**: Bob's unlock is stored on-chain permanently
4. **Future Access**: Bob never pays again for this chapter
