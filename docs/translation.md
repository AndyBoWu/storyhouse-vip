# Translation System

## How It Works

1. **Author posts opportunity** - "Need Spanish translation, offering 75% revenue"
2. **Translator applies** - Submits credentials
3. **Translator works** - Creates translation
4. **AI verifies** - Quality check (80+ score required)
5. **Author approves** - Final review
6. **Author mints IP** - Owns translation, translator gets revenue share

## Revenue Split

```
Reader pays 1 TIP for Spanish chapter:
- Translator: 0.75 TIP (75%)
- Author: 0.25 TIP (25%)
```

## Why Authors Own Translations

- Clean licensing deals (one owner)
- Quality control
- Can replace bad translations
- Bundle all languages for movie rights
