    \item \textbf{High IP registration costs}: \$1000+ for full book IP protection
    \item \textbf{Platform dependency}: 30-50\% revenue shares to centralized platforms
    \item \textbf{Complex licensing}: Manual negotiations for derivative works
    \item \textbf{High barriers}: Technical and financial obstacles for new creators
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reader Pain Points}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Subscription fatigue}: \$200+ monthly across multiple platforms
    \item \textbf{No value capture}: Time and attention generate zero economic return
    \item \textbf{Platform lock-in}: Non-transferable purchases and limited ownership
    \item \textbf{Discovery challenges}: Difficulty finding relevant, high-quality content
\end{itemize}
