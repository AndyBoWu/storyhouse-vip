# Date Accuracy Rule

## IMPORTANT: Always Use Correct Dates

When writing dates in documentation, commits, or any other content:

1. **Current Date**: Today is June 18, 2025 (not January 2025)
2. **Format**: Use "June 2025" or "2025-06-18" format
3. **Never assume**: Don't use placeholder dates like "January 2025"
4. **Be specific**: When referencing "current" or "now", use the actual current date

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ "January 2025" (wrong month)
- ❌ "Q1 2025" (we're in Q2)
- ❌ Future dates beyond June 2025 without clear indication
- ✅ "June 2025" (correct)
- ✅ "Q2 2025" (correct)
- ✅ "June 18, 2025" (correct with specific date)

## For Roadmaps
- Q1 2025: January-March (past)
- Q2 2025: April-June (current)
- Q3 2025: July-September (future)
- Q4 2025: October-December (future)
