## Current Focus
Completed comprehensive documentation structure analysis across the entire ./docs folder to identify optimization opportunities and streamline the knowledge base.

## Completed This Session
- ✅ Analyzed all 23 markdown files across 7 documentation folders
- ✅ Reviewed content focus, length, and overlap for each document
- ✅ Identified redundant information and consolidation opportunities
- ✅ Assessed folder organization and structural improvements
- ✅ Evaluated documentation quality and relevance
- ✅ Prepared detailed recommendations for docs reorganization

## Documentation Analysis Summary

**Total Documentation Analyzed:**
- 23 markdown files across 7 folders
- ~2,100 total lines of documentation
- Multiple overlapping topics and redundant content identified

**Key Findings:**
- Significant overlap between technical implementation files
- Multiple product specification documents with similar content
- Outdated test scenarios and user journey documentation
- Inconsistent depth and quality across documents
- Fragmented information that could be consolidated

## Key Decisions Made
- Prioritize merging overlapping technical documentation
- Consolidate product specifications into single comprehensive guide
- Archive or remove outdated test documentation
- Restructure folders for better logical organization
- Maintain tokenomics documentation as separate specialized section

## Active Work
- Branch: main
- Feature: Documentation structure optimization
- Services Running: All deployed to cloud

## Next Steps
- Implement recommended documentation consolidation plan
- Create new streamlined folder structure
- Merge overlapping content while preserving key information
- Update cross-references and navigation
- Archive outdated documentation appropriately

## Notes for Next Session
- Complete documentation analysis provides clear roadmap for optimization
- Significant opportunity to reduce documentation maintenance overhead
- Focus on creating single authoritative sources for each topic area
- Maintain backward compatibility for any external documentation links
