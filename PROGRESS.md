# StoryHouse Progress Report
Last Updated: 2025-01-10 22:15:00

## Current Focus
Fixed diagram alignment issues in tokenomics whitepaper after completing comprehensive search of codebase.

## Completed This Session
- ✅ Conducted comprehensive search for circular token economy diagram across codebase
- ✅ Found diagram in both `/apps/frontend/public/TOKENOMICS_WHITEPAPER.md` and `/docs/tokenomics/TOKENOMICS_WHITEPAPER.md`
- ✅ Fixed vertical line alignment issues in "READ-TO-EARN", "CREATE-TO-OWN", "REMIX-TO-SHARE" diagram
- ✅ Updated both whitepaper copies with properly aligned arrows pointing to "CIRCULAR TOKEN ECONOMY" box

## Key Findings
### Current SDK Version Status
- **Current Version**: v1.3.1 (both frontend and backend)
- **Latest Version**: v1.3.2
- **Breaking Changes Documented**:
  - `chainId` parameter type change from string to number
  - Royalty module parameter mapping updates
  - TypeScript interface updates required

### SDK Enhancement Plan Overview
The plan document details a comprehensive 16-week roadmap to implement advanced Story Protocol features:
- **Phase 1**: SDK upgrade and licensing system (weeks 1-3)
- **Phase 2**: Royalty distribution system (weeks 4-6)
- **Phase 3**: Derivative & remix system (weeks 7-10)
- **Phase 4**: Group IP collections (weeks 11-13)
- **Phase 5**: WIP token integration & DeFi (weeks 14-16)

### Current Implementation Status
- Basic IP registration implemented (~20% of SDK capabilities)
- Missing advanced features: PIL licensing, royalty distribution, derivatives
- Some blockchain features temporarily disabled for migration (noted in code comments)

## Active Work
- Branch: main
- Feature: SDK version research and upgrade planning
- Services Running: None (research phase)

## Next Steps
- Consider upgrading to SDK v1.3.2 to access latest features
- Review breaking changes and plan migration strategy
- Test SDK upgrade in isolated environment first
- Begin Phase 1 of enhancement plan if upgrade is successful

## Notes for Next Session
- SDK enhancement plan is comprehensive and well-documented
- Breaking changes from v1.3.1 to v1.3.2 are manageable
- Consider starting with SDK upgrade before implementing new features
- Some blockchain integrations currently disabled (see `/api/ip/register/route.ts`)
