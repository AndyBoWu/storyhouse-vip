2. **Access Control Tests** - Role-based permissions, unauthorized operations
3. **Business Logic Edge Cases** - Zero amounts, insufficient balances, duplicate operations
4. **Batch Operations Tests** - Empty arrays, oversized arrays, mixed valid/invalid data
5. **Revenue Distribution Tests** - Zero shares scenarios, complex pricing structures
6. **Contract State Management** - Pause/unpause functionality, book deactivation
7. **View Functions Tests** - Non-existent data queries, progress tracking
8. **Complex Multi-Contract Scenarios** - Cross-contract interactions, integration flows
