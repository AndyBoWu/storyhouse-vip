# StoryHouse Progress Report
Last Updated: 2025-01-10 12:15:00

## Current Focus
Successfully deployed both frontend and backend to Vercel with proper domain routing. Fixed the issue where both domains were showing the backend API page.

## Completed This Session
- ✅ Diagnosed domain routing issue - both testnet and api-testnet were pointing to same deployment
- ✅ Deployed frontend to new Vercel project (andy-wus-projects/frontend)
- ✅ Deployed backend to Vercel project (andy-wus-projects/storyhouse-backend)
- ✅ Assigned domains correctly:
  - testnet.storyhouse.vip → Frontend application
  - api-testnet.storyhouse.vip → Backend API
- ✅ Verified both deployments are accessible and serving correct content

## Current Status
- Frontend: ✅ Live at https://testnet.storyhouse.vip (Vercel)
- Backend: ✅ Live at https://api-testnet.storyhouse.vip (Vercel)
- R2 Storage: ❌ Configuration error - "Invalid URL" when connecting

## Key Decisions Made
- Moved to unified Vercel-only architecture as planned
- Created separate Vercel projects for frontend and backend
- Maintained Cloudflare for DNS only (CNAME records point to Vercel)

## Active Work
- Branch: main
- Feature: R2 storage configuration fix
- Next: Debug and fix R2 configuration in backend API

## Deployment URLs
- Frontend Production: https://frontend-ppsekm36s-andy-wus-projects.vercel.app
- Backend Production: https://storyhouse-backend-hthpr4bqv-andy-wus-projects.vercel.app
- Frontend Domain: https://testnet.storyhouse.vip
- Backend Domain: https://api-testnet.storyhouse.vip

## Next Steps
- Fix R2 configuration error in backend (Invalid URL issue)
- Test story creation and retrieval functionality
- Deploy mainnet versions if needed
- Verify all API endpoints work correctly

## Notes for Next Session
- Both sites are now properly deployed and accessible
- Frontend shows the StoryHouse application interface
- Backend shows API status page and endpoints are reachable
- Main issue remaining: R2 storage configuration needs fixing
