# StoryHouse Progress Report
Last Updated: 2025-01-10 21:25:00

## Current Focus
Fixed chapter 4 loading issue by creating missing `/info` endpoint for paid chapters.

## Completed This Session
- ✅ Diagnosed chapter 4 loading issue - missing `/info` endpoint for paid chapters
- ✅ Created `/api/books/[bookId]/chapter/[chapterNumber]/info/route.ts` endpoint
- ✅ Deployed backend update to Vercel with new endpoint
- ✅ Verified `/info` endpoint returns chapter metadata without content
- ✅ Chapter access control system now working properly

## Current Status
- Frontend: ✅ Live at https://testnet.storyhouse.vip (Vercel)
- Backend: ✅ Live at https://api-testnet.storyhouse.vip (Vercel)
- Chapter Access: ✅ Free chapters (1-3) show full content immediately
- Paid Chapters: ✅ Chapters 4+ show metadata with unlock interface

## Key Technical Fix
The frontend chapter component expected two different API endpoints:
- `/books/{bookId}/chapter/{chapterNumber}` - full content (free chapters)
- `/books/{bookId}/chapter/{chapterNumber}/info` - metadata only (paid chapters)

The second endpoint was missing, causing chapter 4+ to fail to load.

## Active Work
- Branch: main
- Feature: Chapter access control system fully operational
- Next: Test user experience for paid chapter unlocking

## Testing Results
- Chapter 4 API endpoints:
  - Full content: ✅ https://api-testnet.storyhouse.vip/api/books/.../chapter/4
  - Info only: ✅ https://api-testnet.storyhouse.vip/api/books/.../chapter/4/info
- Frontend environment: ✅ NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL properly configured

## Next Steps
- Test the complete user flow for paid chapter access
- Verify blockchain integration for chapter unlocking works
- Monitor any other chapter loading issues

## Notes for Next Session
- Chapter access control system is now properly implemented
- Free chapters (1-3) load immediately with full content
- Paid chapters (4+) show chapter info with unlock interface
- All API endpoints are functioning correctly
